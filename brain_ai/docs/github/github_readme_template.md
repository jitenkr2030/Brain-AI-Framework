## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-ai-framework.git
cd brain-ai-framework

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run your first Brain AI system
python examples/customer-support/app.py
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from brain_ai import BrainAI

# Initialize Brain AI with memory capacity
brain = BrainAI(memory_capacity=1000)

# Store important information
brain.learn("customer_preference", "Prefers detailed explanations")

# Think with memory context
response = brain.think("How should I respond to this customer?")

# AI learns and improves from feedback
brain.feedback(response, feedback_quality="positive")
```
