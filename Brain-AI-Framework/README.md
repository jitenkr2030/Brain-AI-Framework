## 🎯 What is Brain AI?

Brain AI is a comprehensive framework that enables AI systems to maintain persistent memory and continuously learn from user interactions. Unlike traditional AI that treats each request independently, Brain AI builds and retains knowledge over time.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Persistent Memory** - AI remembers context across conversations and sessions
- **Continuous Learning** - System improves from user feedback and interactions
- **Production Ready** - Built for enterprise-scale deployments
- **Multi-Language Support** - SDKs for Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, Go, Ruby, PHP, Rust

## 🚀 Quick Start

**👉 Start Free → Run Your First Brain AI in 5 Minutes**

### Installation
```bash
# Install core framework
pip install brain-ai-core

# Try it immediately
python -c "
from brain_ai import BrainAI
brain = BrainAI()
memory = brain.memories.create('Customer prefers product X')
print(f'Memory created: {memory.id}')
"
```

### Run Examples
```bash
# Clone and try examples
git clone https://github.com/jitenkr2030/Brain-AI-Framework.git
cd Brain-AI-Framework/open_source/examples

# Choose your industry
cd customer-support
python app.py

# Or try knowledge management
cd ../knowledge-management  
python app.py
```

### Available Examples
- **Customer Support** - AI that remembers customer history
- **Knowledge Management** - Persistent organizational knowledge
- **Content Creation** - AI with creative memory
- **Sales Intelligence** - Persistent customer insights
- **Legal Research** - Memory for case precedents
- **Medical Diagnosis** - Clinical knowledge retention
- **Project Management** - Persistent project context
