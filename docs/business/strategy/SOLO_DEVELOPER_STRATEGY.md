## 📋 Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6) - Solo Execution

### **🎯 MVP Strategy: "Brain AI Core"**

#### **Month 1-2: Core Implementation**
```python
# Priority 1: Core Brain Pipeline
class SimpleBrainAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.encoder = BasicEncoder()
        self.memory = SimpleMemoryStore()
        self.learning = BasicLearningEngine()
        self.reasoning = SimpleReasoningEngine()
    
    async def think(self, input_data):
        # Simple but working brain pipeline
        pattern = self.encoder.encode(input_data)
        memories = self.memory.retrieve(pattern)
        result = self.reasoning.analyze(memories, input_data)
        return result
```

**Deliverable**: Working Python library + simple web interface

#### **Month 3-4: Value Demonstration**
```python
# Priority 2: Unique Use Cases

        # Uses brain-inspired memory
        relevant_experiences = await self.brain.retrieve_similar_queries(customer_query)
        response = await self.brain.generate_response(relevant_experiences)
        return response

class PersonalAssistant:
    """AI that learns user preferences"""
    
    async def suggest_action(self, context):
        # Learns from past user actions
        learned_preferences = await self.brain.get_user_preferences()
        return self.brain.recommend_action(context, learned_preferences)
